### 3. Create a Presale

Set up a Presale for the token you've just crafted. Input your tokenâ€™s address and select USDT as a funding source to attract investment. This allows you to buy back your token using the USDT obtained earlier.

### 4. Update Presale Metadata

Enhance your Presale's appeal by updating its metadata via the control panel. Navigate to the dashboard, select your Presale, and enrich it with a custom logo and a comprehensive description.

### 5. Initialize your Presale

Initialize your Presale from the control panel, ensuring that each new round sees an increase in the price and number of tokens available. Refer to the preliminary calculations to align your Presale with optimal tokenomics.

### 6. Buy From Presale

Make your purchase using the USDT tokens. This step should be done after the Presale is initialized.

### 7. Complete the Presale

Once a transaction is made, proceed to the control panel to close your Presale. You may opt to end the Presale early if not all tokens are sold.
