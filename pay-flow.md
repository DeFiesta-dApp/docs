# Pay Flow

A mechanism that allows users to receive passive income in a fully automated mode. The service is built on the concept of a "deposit queue", in which each participant gets a predetermined payout and can also enable a reinvestment function to automatically create new deposits using the profits earned.

## How does it work?

1. **Joining the Queue**\
   You send a fixed amount to the smart contract for the selected pool to take a place in the queue. At this point, you can enable automatic reinvestment of your payout.
2. **Payout Formation**\
   Each new deposit is used to pay participants who joined the queue before you. As soon as the accumulated amount covers your payout, you exit the queue.
3. **Automatic Reinvestment (Optional)**\
   If the reinvestment flag was enabled when joining, the payout is not sent to your wallet. Instead, it automatically creates new deposits - putting you back in the queue without any extra steps.
4. **Automatic Payout**\
   If reinvestment is disabled, your payout is automatically sent to your wallet once the cycle completes.
