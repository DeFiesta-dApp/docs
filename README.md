* An educational platform "Contests" for beginners with training in a testnet environment.

### Benefits for Investors in DeFiesta:

* Transparent presales conducted via smart contracts. Token purchases and wallet deposits occur in a single transaction, or tokens are locked and automatically credited to the investor at the time of listing.
* Built-in protection against scams and fraud. Presales ensure that the collected liquidity is allocated to the specified DEX in a predetermined ratio. Once launched, the presale contract owner cannot change parameters or percentage allocations.
* Automatic liquidity addition after presale. The smart contract automatically adds liquidity and creates a trading pair upon completion. The owner cannot withdraw liquidity from the contract.
* Early-round presale participation in DeFiesta. Presales may include multiple rounds: the earlier you participate, the lower the price and the more limited the token supply, increasing potential ROI.

### Benefits for Airdrop Participants:

* Gamified token distribution through TMA (Telegram Mini App). Play Tetris, upgrade cards for passive income, and complete tasks.
* Protection against bots and auto-clickers. Core game mechanics (Tetris) are synchronized with the server, preventing bot usage and automated clickers.
* Increased rewards through the referral system. By default, 200,000 coins are awarded for each invited friend. After 10 invites, an additional 5% of their earnings is credited.

* Instant payouts for referred users.
* Transparent affiliate program with detailed statistics tracking.
* Ambassador status with exclusive privileges.
