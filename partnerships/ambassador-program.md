# Ambassador Program

At DeFiesta, we understand the value of a strong community and the impact of those who are deeply committed to our mission. This understanding led to the creation of the DeFiesta Ambassador Program, an initiative aimed at recognizing and empowering our most enthusiastic supporters.

## **The Role of an Ambassador**

As an ambassador, you're more than just a supporter; you're a pivotal figure in our journey. Ambassadors are tasked with several key responsibilities:

* **Brand Representation:** Carry the DeFiesta brand into various communities, showcasing the values and vision that make our platform stand out.
* **Education:** Help onboard new users by providing them with the knowledge and resources they need to navigate our ecosystem successfully.
* **Community Growth:** Contribute ideas and efforts towards expanding our user base and enhancing user engagement across the platform.

If you're passionate about DeFiesta and believe in the power of community-driven growth, we invite you to consider the Ambassador Program. Your dedication, insight, and enthusiasm can help steer DeFiesta towards new horizons and contribute to a more inclusive and accessible decentralized world.
