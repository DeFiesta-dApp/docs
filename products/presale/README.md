# Presale

## What Is a Presale?

A presale is the sale of tokens before they are listed on exchanges at a special price. Imagine buying shares of a successful company before it goes public on the stock market.

#### The platform offers the ability to create a multi-round presale.

In each round, the price increases while the number of tokens decreases. This makes the initial rounds the most attractive for investors and allows the project to launch faster. Listing occurs automatically after all rounds are completed or if the presale is closed early by the administrator. The trading pair is created automatically, and the initial price is set at the last round's price.
