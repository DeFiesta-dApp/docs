# Testnet Tutorial

Exploring the capabilities of DeFiesta's decentralized finance (DeFi) services in a risk-free environment is crucial for understanding their functionality and potential impact. This guide walks you through the process of testing DeFiesta products on the Sepolia testnet, a popular Ethereum testing environment. This step-by-step approach ensures you can experiment with our services confidently and securely.

## Setting Up a Crypto Wallet for Sepolia

First, you'll need a compatible crypto wallet that supports Ethereum's testnets, such as MetaMask. Once installed, add the Sepolia testnet to your wallet using the following network details:

* **Network Name:** Sepolia Test Network
* **RPC URL:** [https://rpc.sepolia.org](https://rpc.sepolia.org)
* **Chain ID:** 11155111
* **Currency Symbol:** ETH
* **Block Explorer URL:** [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)

## Acquiring Test ETH

To interact with DeFiesta's services on the testnet, you'll need test ETH. Acquire this from a faucet specific to the Sepolia network. This process mimics real transactions without any real-world financial risk.
