description: Your Chance to Earn DFI Tokens

# Game

The TMA (Telegram Mini App) game offers a unique opportunity to earn DeFiesta (DFI) tokens in a fair and exciting way. We developed this project to ensure fair token distribution among participants while preventing the use of bots and auto-clickers. The game is based on the classic Tetris, where success depends solely on your skills and engagement.

### **How Does the Game Work?**

* **Gameplay**: The game features a classic Tetris format where you need to score points by clearing lines made from falling blocks. The more lines you clear, the higher your score and rewards.
* **Rewards**: Based on your performance, you will earn DFI tokens. The game has allocated **2,000,000 DFI** (equivalent to **$1,000,000**) in prize tokens. The higher your score, the more tokens you receive.
* **Daily Challenges**: The game offers daily challenges that grant additional tokens. These challenges vary in difficulty and allow you to hone your skills and increase your token balance.

### **Why TMA?**

TMA is designed to give every participant an equal opportunity to earn rewards. All games occur in real-time, and results are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring fairness and transparency. Players cannot use automated tools to gain points, as our system detects and blocks such actions, rewarding only real participants.
